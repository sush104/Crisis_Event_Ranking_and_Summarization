# Title: Contextual fact ranking, and summarization using word embedding for emergency responders
Crisis Event Ranking and Summarization is a final project of my Master's degree. This including information retrieval and document ranking from various online data streams. Summarizing those important events and ranking by importance. Emergency responders are the ones who always want up-to-date information about crises occurring around them. To provide them with actionable information understanding various aspects of crisis information that is available on online streams like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and news articles is critical. The extraction of meaningful and serviceable information from such enormous streams has always been an issue. Information Retrieval (IR) systems are designed to solve these issues with document ranking and precise summarization. Document ranking is optimizing the search by ranking the document as per some similarity scores so that only related and most similar documents from the collection are presented to the user for his query. Many document ranking techniques are available and traditionally they use statistical functions to generate similarity or relativity scores. With the huge scope of data, new techniques are being introduced to have efficient document ranking. Along with the document ranking, emergency responders are looking for only a summary means only short details about the crisis events like the actual need, area of action, and type of service. After the extraction of actionable crisis events from the above-mentioned streams, the actual facts are retrieved and presented to emergency responders so that they can take action. The Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) is constantly developing and aiming to use these social media platforms for helping emergency responders with their quick and precise responses and so I find the state-of-art and improved information retrieval pipeline using the Word Embedding technique to embed the user query for efficient ranking and summary generation.
